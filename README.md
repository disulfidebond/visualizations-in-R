Collection of commonly used data visualizations in R

This is a list of commonly used data visualizations in R, including creating a volcano plot, PCA Plot, and a Heatmap for RNASeq experiments.

A lot of this was derived from the DESeq2 [Vignette](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.pdf), and *R Graphics Cookbook* by Winston Chang, Â©2013 Oreilly Press, for which much credit goes.

## Usage
The script is designed to be a template for use in R or RStudio, and is not intended to be run as a standalone script, although a future update will make it work this way, if I have time.
